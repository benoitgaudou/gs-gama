This is a Gama plug-in allowing a connection between Gama and other applications supporting the NetStream protocol, such as GraphStream-based applications. Gama agents can use its primitives to send graph events. By receiving and processing these events, the external application can maintain and analyze a dynamic graph view. we can notice that a node or an edge is not necessarily a Gama agent. In fact, each Gama agent can create a whole graph. The agents can also receive graph events from external applications and use them to take their decisions.
